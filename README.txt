=== Randomdirectory ===

Description: 
Find a random directory on your system. Ideal for hiding things in places where people
would never have thought they were... or to just explore your filesystem :)

Usage:  
./randomdir.php [-v] [directory=.]

Example output:  
firefox-sync/server-full/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/tests/

Example usage:  
luc@luc-mint2 ~ $ cd `./randdir.php` # mind the backticks
luc@luc-mint2 ~/p/downloaded/fftw-3.3.2/rdft/scalar/r2r/.libs $ # random directory!
